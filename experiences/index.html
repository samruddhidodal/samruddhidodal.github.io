  <a id="welisten"> NGO-We Listen</a>
<img src="/img/welisten.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:auto; padding-right: 30px;">
<p> Currently working as a Core Team Member at <a href="https://ngowelisten.org/">NGO - We Listen </a>. Our vision is to create a safe space for adolescents and young people, where they are listened to and are addressed about their feelings. Our mission is to create awareness, break the stigma, and lend support to those suffering from mental health problems. We also plan to connect the concerned person with a professional where needed. </p>

<a id="semex"> Exchange student, Politecnico di Milano, Italy </a>
<img src="/img/olasnowman.jpg" style="float:right;width:auto;height:200px; padding-left: 30px;">
<p> One of the most life-changing experiences I had was the semester I spent in Italy. Along with being the first time that I ever travelled abroad, it was also the first time I stayed away from family for more than a couple of months. It was a lot of learning, and a lot of fun. I almost instantly fell in love with the culture, beauty and the people of Italy. It was also the time I started trying writing (check <a href="/blogs">blogs</a>) and also maintained a travelogue where I could describe my daily experiences (check instagram icon << ). Travelled to 13 countries; but so much in love with Italy that I dropped a euro in the water at Fontana di Trevi in Rome with the dream of going back to stay in Italy for a couple of years :)

  <em><b>It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living, I want to know what you ache for. It doesn’t interest me how old you are, I want to know if you are willing to risk looking like a fool for love, for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive. I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine. It doesn’t interest me where you live or how rich you are, I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and be sweet to the ones you love. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and truly like the company you keep in the empty moments of your life.</b></em>

  The Design Club is one of the first bodies in the Institute that I became a part of and has stayed close to my heart ever since. Worked on innovating publicity campaigns and other initiatives and successfully improved the engagement for the filmmaking club & the Classical and Folk Arts Club. Mentored freshmen to create some awesome branding designs that you can check out <a href="https://www.behance.net/iitbdesign">here</a>. Some work and memories :)

<a id="ecell"> Events Manager, The Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Bombay</a>
<img src="/img/esummit.jpg" style="float:right;width:auto;height:200px; padding-left: 30px;">
<p> Have been involved with the <a href="https://www.ecell.in/2019/">E-Cell </a>on campus as an Events Manager. I made some amazing friends while working on ways to tackle the stagnant startup culture in the institute. Whether it was introducing a business model competition to give freshmen exposure to working of startups, or facilitating the conversion of research into tech startups - the journey had a lot of highs and lows and is one I cherish. Apart from honing my leadership and team-work skills, I got to interact with entrepreneurs and investors, and get an insider's view of the startup ecosystem.  </p>

<a id="wingies"> Spending 5 years at IIT Bombay - Wingies &#9829 </a>

<p> I had the fortune of sharing my stay and my hostel room and wing with some of the kindest and strongest women, and I continue to learn and be inspired from every single one of them. Whether it was supporting each other through the lows or celebrating our victories together or making some great memories together inside and out of insti, we did it all :)
  Trips to Mahabaleshwar, Surat, Alibaug, Goa, and Ladakh will be forever treasured :D

<a id="cadbury"> Interning at a Cadbury (Mondelez) Plant!! </a>
<img src="/img/cadbury.jpg" style="float:right;width:auto;height:240px; padding-left: 10px;">
<p> While improving efficiency and reducing wastage is what this was supposed to be about, I COULD NOT stop drooling over the tonnes of chocolate - (Silk, Bournville, Temptations and more) I saw every day. The plant operators and friends I made at the hostel I stayed were always super nice. These friends arranged a (illegal :P) party inside a hostel room the day I was leaving, complete with a cake, sandwiches, songs and balloons! 
  Anecdote! - One of the friendly operators (must be older than my dad, I used to call them all *kaka*) called me from about 30 ft away with a sense of urgency. He was dewrapping a huge box of Bournvilles that had gotten rejected from Quality Dept for some petty reasons. As I walked to him, he handed me over half a bar and said (in Marathi) "Beta have you even gained any kgs in the last month? The least you should leave with after this internship is a few extra kgs" :D

<a id="schlum"> Being a Junior Field Engineer at Schlumberger </a>
<img src="/img/slb.jpg" style="float:left;width:auto;height:200px; padding-right: 10px;">
<p> Got to see an oil rig for the first time and worked with some super cool people and also did an explosive job on one of the rigs near Baroda, where they let me handle tools that are possibly very dangerous! Also first ever paycheck haha :D

<a id="dance"> Trying Dancing :D </a>
<img src="/img/AIDS16.jpg" style="float:right;width:auto;height:200px; padding-left: 10px;">
<p> 
  I find dance as an art form to express emotion admirable, and dancers who do move effortlessly making even difficult movements seem simple amaze me. I tried dancing in school, and then a couple of times in insti. I have a soft spot for Classical dancing, which has now moved towards Ballet/Lyrical Jazz.
  <br />

  If you have ~ 10 minutes and want to watch something moving, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNYqDKwa0sM">this</a> is one of the performances I was a part of and would definitely recommend watching for the message it conveys.
